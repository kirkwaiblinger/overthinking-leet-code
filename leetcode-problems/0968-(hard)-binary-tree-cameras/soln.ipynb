    "- The problem asks for the minimum number of nodes necessary. We should be able to establish a mathematical upper bound for the minimum without fully traversing the tree\n",

    "- There is no use in any leaf node being a camera (except for the edge case in which it's also the root). In general, putting the camera on the parent will either decrease or keep the same the number of cameras needed.\n",

    "- When we have branches, each camera can potentially account for up to 4 nodes, so the minimum must be `MIN_CAMERAS >= ceiling(n / 4)` nodes. The degenerate case is the worst case, so in general we have `ceiling(n / 4) <= MIN_CAMERAS <= ceiling(n / 3)`\n",

    "Note that there's some holes to fill in. The obvious question is: how do we figure out whether a child node is a camera, watched, or unwatched? A given node knows whether it is a camera, watched, or unwatched, based on the value of its children alone, i.e. a node shouldn't traverse layers deep of its children to find out what state a child is in, since the child already knows. IMO it's a little hacky, but with generators we can both yield values (the known cameras, to be just re-yielded) AND return a value (direct child-to-parent communication). So let's just do that."
