    "- The two-dimensional grid is a shameless red herring. We just need one call to random, and we can map the random int to the size of the matrix with modulo operations\n",
    "- Can split the output of the Python random function into n chunks to get arbitrary number of integers evenly distributed.\n",
    "- The tricky part will be keeping track of not returning the same location twice.\n",
    "- We don't need to store an actual `m * n` grid in memory; that's just a mental model of what we're doing."

    "This took me quite some fiddling with on paper. In order to make sure we don't pick the same number twice, we're going to have to mark a number as already used. However, let's say we pick a number that has already been rolled. We're definitely not calling `random()` again, since we have a valid random number. How do we remap this though to an available index?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - while working on this, I noticed Python has a `randrange()` function for uniformly distributed integers, so no need to do any of that ourselves. Nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, my solution is let's keep track of the number of possible indices to still be checked. Request a random int in that range. Remap any index that has been picked to the max available number (since that won't be called again, after decrementing the number of indices to be checked).\n",

    "And at the end, convert the index to a pair `(i, j)` via integer arithmetic (uninteresting)."
