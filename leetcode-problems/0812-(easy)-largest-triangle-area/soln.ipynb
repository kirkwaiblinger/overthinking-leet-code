    "## Initial Thoughts\n",
    "- The example provided on leetcode shows a configuration where finding the points with max/min coordinates gives the biggest triangle. That is not true in general\n",
    "- Played around for quite some time with figuring out whether reflecting triangles about various axes is of any use towards determining their area, either exactly or approximately. It does not seem to be. Obviously the classic formula for triangle area is `1/2 * base * height`, which (again) works for the triangle shown in the example, not for a general triangle. Indeed, this would work with any triangle with multiple points aligned on an axis... But that's not what we're working with.\n",
    "- Can bounding boxes help us? We definitely don't need to check a triangle whose bounding box is smaller than the the known area.\n",
    "- However, unclear that the above allows us to save on time complexity\n",
    "- Speaking of which, the dumb way to solve this problem is just find all combinations of points and compute areas, which is an `O(n^3)` operation. \n",
    "- It occurs to me that, while working on other things, I've run into the concept of quad trees and such... that might be able to help us here."
